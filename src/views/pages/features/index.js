                    With Vanila Community's Rep system, you can see how active
                    and constructive a member is in your community - and
                    globally across communities - which makes it simple to
                    figure out if an issue is a trend or an isolated incident.

                    Identifying a problem is one thing, but it can still be hard
                    to know how to act on a moderation issue. SAM (Spectrum
                    Assistant Moderator) helps you make those decisions by
                    recommending proven solutions, automatically flagging toxic
                    messages for removal, and even addressing issues with
                    problematic members (all with your permission of course).
